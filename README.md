PiMessage
=========

This is a peer to peer messenger program which connects two or more Linux
devices over the internet. Users on each native Linux device can send each
other messages. If the user is on a raspberry pi, then sending over GPIO
pins is also an option.

Functionality
---------
Some project features will include:

1. Sending messages over internet
2. Handshake authentication system, allowing users to connect to each other securely and knowingly
3. User interface (CLI and possibly GUI)
4. Sending a "so-and-so is writing something" message, similar to some other messaging systems
5. Messaging over GPIO pins for the Raspberry Pi

Development
---------
This project is still under devlopment and is not yet ready to be used. We
will update our README once this project is at a somewhat usable state.

Until then, hang tight!
